Sleuth was an attempt to make a variation of Clue that worked in the browser over the internet. 
It was more accurately my attepmt to learn to use Python for the first time, and eventually 
some JS and PHP. It didn't get that far due to me not having the time to put into it or the 
knowledge to easily pick up new langauges. This is still here on the off chance I decide 
to pick it back up. Perhaps with the expertise I have now I could accomplish it in a 
resonable timeframe, but my inspiration is lacking due to new ways to play board games 
online making it obsolete.
